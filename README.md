# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Create two separate graphs based on the following criteria. A chart that examines the launch date of Kickstarters compared to the outcome. Also, filter the data based on "Parent Category" and "Years".
The second chart required comparing the Goal amount to the outcome of the Kickstarters.
### Background
The task was to help Louise get a better understanding of the Kickstarter data initially given.
Louise specifically wanted to know how the date a Kickstarter campaign was launched and the goal amount of money the campaign asked for impacted the eventual success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There is an increase in the number of successful Kickstarter campaigns in May and June. These two months would be the ideal time for Louise to begin her campaign.
The number of failed Kickstarter campaigns does not appear to be affected by the month it launches.
### Outcomes Based on Goal
The Outcomes Based on Goal chart presents two distinct patterns.
Goals of less than 5,000 have about a 75% chance of success. Goals from the range of 5,000 to 24,999 see a drop to about 50% successful.
The Goals greater than 25,000 see an inconsistent pattern, possibly due to a limited sample size.
### Limitations
Looking at the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals presented a challenge. There is limited data to pull from when the goal amounts reached the higher levels.
The Goals of less than 15,000 has 961 Kickstarters. The remaining eight intervals only contain 86 Kickstarters. It is difficult to conclude on the relationship of Goals and Outcomes with a limited amount of data points.
### Recommendations
An additional graph could be Outcomes based on the number of days a Kickstarter was active. To do this, we would create a row called Total Days Active (Date Ended Conversion - Date Created Conversion). Then use the COUNTIFS function to create intervals, and make the chart using the same method as Outcomes Based on Goals.
Louise would be able to see if there is a length of time where the outcome's success significantly changes.
